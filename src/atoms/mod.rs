//! Atom functions for building expressions.
//!
//! Atoms are the building blocks of optimization problems. They include:
//!
//! - **Affine atoms**: Operations that preserve linearity (add, mul, sum, reshape, etc.)
//! - **Nonlinear atoms**: Operations with specific curvature (norms, quadratic forms, etc.)
